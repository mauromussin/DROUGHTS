    "## What is a drought?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply stated, drought is ‘the extreme persistence of precipitation deficit over a specific region for a specific period of time’ $^1$. Droughts are often classified into three main types different by their severity, impacts, and time scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <ins>Meteorological drought</ins> is often caused by short-term precipitation deficiency and its impacts highly depend on its timing. For example, lack of rain during the sprouting phase in rain-fed agriculture could lead to crop failure. \n",
    "2. <ins>Agricultural drought</ins> is a medium-term phenomenon, characterized by reduced soil moisture content and is caused by a prolonged period of meterological drought. \n",
    "3. On the long-term, <ins>hydrological drought</ins> is characterized by lower stream flow, reduced water level in water bodies, and may affect groundwater storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cascade between drought types is goverened by the severity (i.e., magnitude), duration, and spatio-temporal distribution of drought events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is drought risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "Drought risk is a measure for quantifying the likelyhood of a meaningfull impact from drought-event(s)\n",
    "on human population, its economic activity and assets, and the environment. The risk for an impact depends on the <ins>drought hazard</ins>, <ins>exposure</ins>, and the <ins>vulnerability</ins> to droughts. <ins>Hazard</ins> measures the magnitude, duration, and timing of drougt events. <ins>Exposure</ins> to droughts represent the spatial distribution of drought relative to distribution of potentially impactful systems, e.g., location of cultivated land, wetlands, etc. Finally, <ins>vulnerability</ins> stands for the level of impact expected for a given system during a given event, and is affected by the systems' intrinsic attributes. For example, fields with drought-resistent crops varities would be less vulnerable to droughts.\n"

    "## How do we assess drought risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different metrics to assess drought risk, which account for at least one of the risk factors: hazard, exposure and vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow quantifies drought risk as the product of drought hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The methodology used here was developed and applied globally by Carrão et al. (2016) $^2$. The result of this workflow is a risk map showing the relative drought risk of different spatial units (i.e., subnational administrative regions) from a larger region (i.e., the European Union). Regional drought risk scores are on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 representing the lowest risk and 1 the highest. The workflows takes each risk determinant (i.e. hazard, exposure and vulnerability) and normalised it taking into account its maximum and minimum values across all sub-national administrative regions. Thus, the results of this drought risk workflow are relative to the sample of geographic regions used for normalisation, and the proposed risk scale is not a measure of absolute losses or actual damage, but a relative comparison of drought risk between the input regions. Therefore, the resulting data and mapping can help the user to assess in which sub-administrative units within a jurisdictions the drought risk will be higher, thus allowing for better resouce allocation and better coordination within and between different levels of government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a description of the data and tools used to calculate drought hazard, exposure and vulnerability, and the outputs of this workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "More expert users can find a more detailed and technical explanation on how hazard, exposure and vulnerability are quantified in the dropdown boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workflow the following data is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial units: \n",
    "\n",
    "We used NUTS2 and NUTS 3 regions which can be downloaded at this link \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hazard data and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drought hazard (dH) for a given region is estimated as the probability of exceedance the median of regional (e.g., EU level) severe precipitation deficits for an historical reference period (e.g. 1979-2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating drought hazard, this workflows requires monthly total precipitation for each NUTS2 or NUTS3 region during the historical reference period. Usually, these are observation-based or simulated time-series of gridded precipitation data. Processing these data is performed by applying Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, to extract an aggregated value (e.g., total precipitation) of the data points located within each area of interest (e.g., NUTS2 region). Zonal statistics is widely used for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point, observation-based datasets are an alternative data source, usually collected by meteorological station networks. One can choose the data collected in one or more (e.g., average) representative station per area of interest to construct a NUTS2 level dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm expects a table in which each row represnt a month-year combination, and each column an area of interest. The first column represnts the date following this format YYYY-MM-DD. The **title of the first columns has to be 'timing', and the rest of the titles has to be the codes of the areas of interest (e.g., NUTS2), which have to be identical to the codes as they appear in the NUTS2 or NUTS3 spatial data from the [European Commision](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/nuts/background)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workflow we used GSWP3 and W5E5 global meteorological forcing data processed for ISIMIP3a, sets on a 0.5°x0.5°C global grid and at daily time steps for the historical period of 1979-2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exposure data and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drought exposure (dE) indicates the potential losses from different types of drought hazards in different geographical regions. In general, exposure data identifies and quantifies the different types of physical entities on the ground, including built assets, infrastructure, agricultural land, people, livestock, etc. that can be affected by drought (e.g. the number of cars does not count).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantyfing drought exposure utilizes a non-compensatory model to account for the spatial distribution of an potential impact for crops and livestock, competition on water (e.g., for industrial uses represented by the water stress indicator), and human direct need (e.g., for drinking represneted by population size). More information can be found in the dropdown box below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workflow we used the following data:\n",

    "\n",
    "in this workflow, the selection of proxy indicators representing the economic, social, and infrastructural factors of drought vulnerability at each geographic location follows the criteria defined by Naumann et al. (2014): the indicator has to represent a quantitative or qualitative aspect of vulnerability factors to drought (generic or specific to some exposed element), and public data need to be freely available at the global scale.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The above workflow estimates the relative drought risk of European NUTS2 regions as the product of drought hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. It results in relative drought risk classes ranging between 1 (low risk, 0 -0.2 risk) to 5 (high risk, 0.8 -1).\n",
    "The European drought risk map shows hotspots with higher drought risk (class 2 -3) in Southern Spain, Northern France, Italy, Hungary, Serbia, and Romania. In the Northern parts of Europe, higher drought risk is shown in Poland, North Germany, Denmark, and parts of the Netherlands and Belgium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Half of the NUTS2 units' hazard scores are high, ranging between 0.73 -0.8. The vulnerability is also relatively homogenous across the region, as half of the NUTS2 units range between 0.8 -0.88. The Balkan is the most vulnerable region having a minimum vulnerability score of 0.89. It means that the overall drought risk is limited mainly by exposure, which do not exceed 0.43 for 75% of the NUTS2 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comparison with published literature$^2$ overall approves the current drought risk map. Although some discrepancies are evident, particularly in NUTS2 units in the Netherlands and Belgium, they may be associated with differences in precipitation data, temporal coverage, spatial resolution, and spatial coverage. Though different input data largely result in consistent drought hazard estimates, it may lead to local discrepancies in different regions (e.g., Central and Northern Europe)$^6$."
