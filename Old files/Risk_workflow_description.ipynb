    "## What is a drought?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply stated, drought is ‘the extreme persistence of precipitation deficit over a specific region for a specific period of time’ $^1$. Droughts are often classified into three main types different by their severity, impacts, and time scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <ins>Meteorological drought</ins> is often caused by short-term precipitation deficiency and its impacts highly depend on its timing. For example, lack of rain during the sprouting phase in rain-fed agriculture could lead to crop failure. \n",
    "2. <ins>Agricultural drought</ins> is a medium-term phenomenon, characterized by reduced soil moisture content and is caused by a prolonged period of meterological drought. \n",
    "3. On the long-term, <ins>hydrological drought</ins> is characterized by lower stream flow, reduced water level in water bodies, and may affect groundwater storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cascade between drought types is goverened by the severity (i.e., magnitude), duration, and spatio-temporal distribution of drought events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is drought risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "Drought risk is a measure for quantifying the likelyhood of a meaningfull impact from drought-event(s)\n",
    "on human population, its economic activity and assets, and the environment. The risk for an impact depends on the <ins>drought hazard</ins>, <ins>exposure</ins>, and the <ins>vulnerability</ins> to droughts. <ins>Hazard</ins> measures the magnitude, duration, and timing of drougt events. <ins>Exposure</ins> to droughts represent the spatial distribution of drought relative to distribution of potentially impactful systems, e.g., location of cultivated land, wetlands, etc. Finally, <ins>vulnerability</ins> stands for the level of impact expected for a given system during a given event, and is affected by the systems' intrinsic attributes. For example, fields with drought-resistent crops varities would be less vulnerable to droughts.\n"

    "## How do we assess drought risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different metrics to assess drought risk, which account for at least one of the risk factors: hazard, exposure and vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow quantifies drought risk as the product of drought hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The methodology used here was developed and applied globally by Carrão et al. (2016) $^2$. The resulting risk map shows relative drought risk classes ranging between 1 (low risk, 0 -0.2 risk) to 5 (high risk, 0.8 -1) of different spatial units (i.e., NUTS2) out of a bigger region (i.e., European Union).\n"
