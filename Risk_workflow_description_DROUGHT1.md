# Risk assessment for drought - Advanced risk workflow


## Risk assessment methodology

Drought risk is a measure for quantifying the likelihood of an impact from a drought event (or multiple events) on the population, economic activities and assets, and on the environment.
The risk is assessed as a combination of drought hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
- Hazard measures the magnitude, duration, and timing of drought events.
- Exposure to droughts represent the spatial distribution of drought relative to distribution of potentially impactful systems, e.g., location of cultivated land, wetlands, etc.
- Vulnerability stands for the level of impact expected for a given system during a given event and is affected by the systems' intrinsic attributes. For example, fields with drought-resistant crop varieties would be less vulnerable to droughts.

This workflow quantifies drought risk as the product of drought hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The methodology used here was developed and applied globally by Carrão et al. (2016) 

## Workflow implementation

See the files Hazard_Assessment.ipynb and Risk_Assessment.ipynb.


## Output of the workflow

The resulting risk map shows relative drought risk classes ranging between 1 (low risk, 0 -0.2 risk) to 5 (high risk, 0.8 -1) of different spatial units (i.e., NUTS2) out of a bigger region (i.e., European Union).

## Contributors

The workflow has been developed by Silvia Artuso and Dor Fridman from IIASA's Water Security Research Group, and supported by Michaela Bachmann from IIASA's Systemic Risk and Resilience Research Group.
